## Hide Facebook Ads using Options

There are two common steps to follow to help remove unwanted Ads from always popping up when you are using your Facebook account. Providing regular feedback to the site leads to the removal of irrelevant Ads whilst Ads that seem to conform to your interests stay. Thus, this does not lead to the full removal of Ads from your Facebook.

The process above is done as follows:

1. When a sponsored Ad appears on your Facebook page, click on the 3 dots button placed on the upper right corner of the post you are viewing  
   1. Click on “Hide Ad” if you don’t want this kind of Ad to appear again  
   2. Alternatively, click on “Report Ad”, if the Ad is offensive to you in any way
2. If you click on Hide Ad”, you will be asked to provide a reason for doing so. You can simply indicate your reasons whether it’s irrelevant or misleading
