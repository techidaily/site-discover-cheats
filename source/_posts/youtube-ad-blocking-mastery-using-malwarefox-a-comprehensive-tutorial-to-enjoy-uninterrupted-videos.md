## Remove ads on YouTube by Downloading Videos

It is possible to download videos from YouTube on to your computer for easy offline viewing at any time or place. You can download YouTube videos using third-party websites such as Clip Grab. And if this process gets a little too cumbersome or confusing for you, adding **ss** into the video’s URL lets you download the videos directly from YouTube. The format is as follows –  https://www.ssyoutube.com However, sometimes you may have too many videos to view that consume so much time to download and some much more data. Thus, downloading your videos may not be the best option to avoid YouTube Ads.

## Subscribe to YouTube Red and Get rid of Ads

YouTube Red offers a paid- premium membership use of the platform. With YouTube Red, the user gets uninterrupted (ad-free) and improved use of the platform. The user also gets access to YouTube Music and Gaming. Pricing for YouTube Red ranges according to the host country, with some users paying up to US$9.99\. The limitation of this improved use of the platform is that it is not yet available in many countries. YouTube Red only works in the USA, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Mexico.

## Use Ad Blocker to Block YouTube Ads

The use of high-quality and trusted YouTube Adblockers is perhaps the most reliable and easiest way to block Ads when streaming your YouTube videos. It is especially convenient if you do not have access to YouTube Red or if you have a high volume of videos you can’t download. Use Ad blockers that are proven to be effective such as [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ad-blocker/kacljcbejojnapnmiifgckbafkojcncf). For the not-to-Tech-informed, going through reputable online reviews on the best Ad blockers also helps you choose the right one. As soon as you install the Ad Blocker on to your computer, the rest is easy.

2. Go the “Creator Studio”, go to the menu on the left and click on the “channel” option

## Other Possibilities

YouTube partner programs such as AdSense lets the viewer filter through Ads powered by them when you are streaming YouTube videos and channels. Simply log into AdSense, go to the “Allow and Block Ads” tab and click on the top-left drop-down menu. Then, click on “Blocking Controls” then choose “YouTube Host”. The pages give you two blocking options – you can either block specific advertisement URLS or generally block all AdSense powered Advertisements. To block specific advertisements, click on the “Advertiser URLs” tab at the top f the page, enter the Url in the space provided then click on “Block URLs”. To block all advertisements, pick the categories on the same page. The added changes are then automatically saved and reflect on YouTube streaming in 24 hours. This option is limited because it will only block Ads powered under AdSense thus; other Ads will still freely pop up in your YouTube streaming experience.
