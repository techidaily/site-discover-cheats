## Where do Hackers Hide Malware?

Hackers have many ways of hiding malware. They can hide it in legitimate websites, email attachments, and even social media links. Hackers will also use fake updates and downloads to trick you into downloading malware onto your computer.

Some of the most common places that hackers hide malware are:

* **Websites:** Websites are a common place for hackers to hide malware. They can do this by adding malicious code to legitimate websites. When you visit the website, the code will automatically download and install malware on your computer.
* **Hiding in Plain Sight:** Hackers will often disguise malware as a harmless file, such as an image or document. When you open the file, the malware will be installed on your computer.
* **Email Attachments:** Hackers can also send malware in email attachments. This is often done by disguising the malware as a harmless file, such as an image or document. When you open the attachment, the malware will be installed on your computer.
* **Social Media Links:** Hackers will also use social media to spread malware. They can do this by sharing links that lead to websites that contain malware. They may also post links that download malware directly onto your computer.
* **Embed in Images:** Hackers can also embed malware in images. This is done by hiding the malware in the code of the image. When you view the image, the malware will be downloaded and installed on your computer.
* **Social Engineering:** Hackers will use social engineering to trick you into downloading malware onto your computer. They may send you an email that appears to be from a legitimate company. The email will contain a link that will download the malware onto your computer.
* **Off-brand apps:** Off-brand or fake apps are another way that hackers can spread malware. These apps are often designed to look like legitimate apps. However, when you install them, they will install malware on your computer.
* **Drive-by Downloads:** Hackers can also use drive-by downloads to install malware on your computer. This is done by adding malicious code to websites. When you visit the website, the code will automatically download and install malware on your computer.
* **Refrigerators:** Yes, even your refrigerator can be used to spread malware. Hackers can gain access to your fridge and use it to send [malicious emails](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/230932) or even launch attacks on other devices on your network.
* **Cars:** Cars are another target for hackers. They can use the onboard computers to gain access to your car’s systems. They can then use your car to access your home network and other devices connected to it.
* **Baby Monitor:** Baby monitors are another target for hackers. They can use the camera and microphone to spy on you and your family. They can also use the baby monitor to launch attacks on other devices on your network.
* **Fake Updates:** Hackers will often create fake updates for programs that you have installed on your computer. When you try to update the program, you will actually be downloading and installing malware onto your computer.
* **Fax Machine:** Fax machines are yet another target for hackers. They can use the fax machine to send malicious faxes or even launch attacks on other devices on your network.
* **Cash Register:** Cash registers are another target for hackers. They can use the cash register to store sensitive data or even launch attacks on other devices on your network.
* **IoT Devices:** IoT devices are another target for hackers. They can use these devices to gain access to your home network and other devices connected to it.

## How do Hackers Hide Malware?

As you can see there are numerous platforms a hacker can hide malware. Now we’ll see how they do it.

### Compressed Packers

A packer is a program that compresses an executable to make it smaller. It wraps the compressed executable in the code necessary to decompress itself at runtime. The act of compression changes the way the executable file looks. This means that virus scanners can’t recognize the malware because they don’t recognize the packer.

### Obfuscation

Obfuscation is a technique used to make code difficult to understand. It’s often used to make malware more difficult to detect and analyze. Hackers will use obfuscation to make it more difficult for antivirus software to detect their malware.

### Encryption

Encryption is a technique used to make data unreadable by anyone who doesn’t have the key to decrypt it. Hackers use encryption to make their malware more difficult to detect and analyze.

### Signature Evasion

Signature evasion is a technique used to make malware more difficult to detect. Hackers will use this technique to make their malware look like something else. This makes it almost impossible for antimalware applications to detect the malware.

### Polymorphic Malware

Polymorphic malware is malware that regularly changes its appearance. This makes it more difficult for antivirus software to detect the malware.

## How to stay protected from Malware?

From bombarding annoying ads to stealing valuable data to lock your files, malware programs can perform various dubious tasks to make our life miserable. It is better to keep devices protected from them instead of dealing with them after the infiltration.

Here are some preventive tips to stay protected from malware:

* Never open and download the attachments sent from an unknown sender. [Emails](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)are one of the oldest and most common means to spread malware.
* Don’t navigate to pirated sites for downloading the paid software and games. Cybercriminals infect legitimate programs with malicious codes so that users install them without any doubt.
* Keep your applications and OS updated with the latest version. Most malware programs exploit the vulnerabilities of apps and operating systems. Regularly updating them will fix the bugs.
* Follow healthy browsing practices while online. Avoid opening unknown, suspicious links.
* Keep your system equipped with a robust antimalware solution. Antimalware solutions are explicitly designed to tackle different malware. It is also essential to keep the security programs updated.
