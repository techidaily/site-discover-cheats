* "Why doesnt vixy.net work? any alternatives where i dont have to download a program?How to download n convert from youtube other than using keepvid n vixy?I've been using keepvid n vixy for downloading youtube vids n convert them to mp4 so i can pay it in my iTouch.however those 2 doesn't seem to work lately..does anybody know other alternatives?"
* "Keepvid now needs program to download videos, is there any alternatives?Besides Clipnabber, Vixy, something that is useful and must be in mp4 format."
* "I notice that lately every time I try to capture a youtube video I get the following error: Error: URL resolve error. (YouTube.com is down??) But, of course, youtube is NOT down and I can go straightaway and play the addressed youtube video directly with no problems. VIXY.net used to always work, but, for some time now I can't capture any video to my PC from youtube using VIXY.net. So, is there yet another method for capturing selected videos from youtube to your PC?"
